# HackSheffield10

# Project Overview
Web application that connects to the Google Gemini API to generate Dungeons and Dragons scenarios and respond to prompts and actions from multiple players. The main AI Agent (The dungeon master) is connected to multiple sub-agents (lore, environment, combat) which are specialised for certain tasks, such as handling combat and explaining the environment. The main agent delegates tasks to these agents when necessary. The app also features image generation of user messages, the ability to create and store basic character sheets and a dice rolling tool.

This project was made during HackSheffield10, where it won Best Newcomer Project.
